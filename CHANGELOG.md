## [0.1.1]

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI workflow and pre-commit hooks (black, isort, ESLint) for linting and formatting, which surfaced and applied linting/formatting changes across the backend and frontend. ([#22](https://github.com/Center-for-AI-Innovation/LLMHub/issues/22))

### Fixed

- `background_service.py`: `shutdown_deployment()`'s return value was not being captured in `_check_expired_deployments()`, leaving `updated`undefined for every expired deployment (shutdown-completion emails were never sent). Fixed by assigning the call's result to `updated`.
